# Title
Music Store Data Analysis
# Overview
This is project I came to know from one of the linkdIn comment so I decided to solve this and generate insight from this data set. I was tasked with helping the Chinook team understand the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

I was given the database which I loaded into DB SQL SERVER to conduct the Analysis.

I will take you through the processes I took in answering the business questions and the insights generated.

Before we proceed, l would like us to understand the database of the music store which contains 11 tables, and below is the schema diagram showing all tables and their relationships to each other.
